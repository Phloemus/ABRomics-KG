# ABRomics-KG

ABRomics-KG is a knowledge graph that allows to store antibiotic resistance data by using the sosa ontology 
and other domain specific ontologies such as ARO (Antibiotic Resistance Ontology).

## Content

In this repo, you will find rdf data and queries used for the article named "A multi-modal and temporal antibiotic resistance knowledge graph" submitted to SWAT4HCLS conference (2025 edition).

## Launch the demo

Along side the rdf graph and queries, you can also explore this graph by yourself !

```
bash
## Clone the ABRomics-KG repository
git clone https://github.com/Phloemus/ABRomics-KG
cd ABRomics-KG
```

```
bash
## Create the provided python environment
```

```
bash
## Launch the streamlit app
```

## Explore the data

Within the demo, you can execute the pre-written queries and even perform you own queries on the knowledge
graph although we encourage you to get familiar with the knowledge graph before performing your own sparql
queries. 

To understand the structure of the graph, go read the reference paper submitted to the SWAT4HCLS conference !
